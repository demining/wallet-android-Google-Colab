### Run wallet-android-Google-Colab

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OShIMVcFZ_khsUIBOIV1lzrqAGo1gfm_?usp=sharing

-------------------------

In order to receive updates quicker than others, you need to enable beta versions of the software in
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.mycelium.wallet)

As beta testers, please make sure you have a recent **backup of the masterseed** and all **private keys** inside Mycelium. Beta testers will experience many bugs.
So far, restoring the wallet from masterseed has never been necessary, but we offer no guarantees.

Building
========

To build everything from source, simply checkout the source and build using gradle on the build system you need:

 * JDK 1.8

The project layout is designed to be used with a recent version of Android Studio (currently 4.1.2)

#### Build commands

To get the source code, type:

    git clone https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet-android.git
    cd wallet-android
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Linux/Mac type:

    ./gradlew clean test mbw::assembleProdnetRelease mbw::assembleBtctestnetRelease

Windows type:

    gradlew.bat clean test mbw::assembleProdnetRelease mbw::assembleBtctestnetRelease

 - Voila, look into `mbw/build/outputs/apk/` to see the generated apk.
   There are versions for both prodnet and testnet.

Alternatively you can install the latest version from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet).

If you cannot access the Play store, you can obtain the apk directly from the Mycelium Bitcoin
Wallet [download page](https://wallet.mycelium.com/contact.html).

App Download Verification
-------------------------

All versions released by Mycelium are signed with the same release keys. If you do not trust the apk
you can check that signature with
[apksigner](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apksigner.html#options-verify):

```
apksigner verify --print-certs --verbose mycelium.apk
```

The output should look like:

```

Deterministic builds
====================

To validate the Mycelium image you obtain from Google Play Store, you can rebuild the Mycelium
wallet yourself using Docker and compare both images following these steps:

* Get the source as above
* Create your own Docker image from our simple Dockerfile

        $ docker build . --tag mycelium-wallet

  Check that this step succeeds by listing the available docker images:

        $ docker images | grep mycelium-wallet

* Use disorderfs to eliminate non-determinism caused by file ordering

        $ mkdir /tmp/s
        $ sudo disorderfs --sort-dirents=yes --reverse-dirents=no --multi-user=yes $PWD /tmp/s
        $ cd /tmp/s

* Build Mycelium using Docker

        $ docker run --rm --volume $(pwd):/project --workdir /project -it mycelium-wallet bash
        # yes | /opt/android-sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager "build-tools;28.0.3"
        # ./gradlew clean :mbw:assProdRel
            
  If you see errors about local paths not being found, remove/move away `local.properties`. Run the
  mycelium-wallet docker with gradle compilation of mbw.
  As docker
  might run as a different user, its generated files will also be "not yours". Make them yours using
  `chown` as super user.
  
  The app can now be found in `mbw/build/outputs/apk/prodnet/release/mbw-prodnet-release.apk`.
  
  As maintainer with release keys you want to run a slightly different command:
  Add these docker parameters: `--volume 'path/to/keys.properties':/project/keys.properties --volume 'path/to/keystore_mbwProd':/project/keystore_mbwProd --volume 'path/to/keystore_mbwTest':/project/keystore_mbwTest`
  Build all these targets `:mbw:assBtctRel :mbw:assProdRel :mbw:assBtctDeb :mbw:assProdDeb`
  and to get an error on missing release keys, add this gradle option `-PenforceReleaseSigning`
  
  Note: for those who use Docker Toolbox $(pwd) should be under your home user folder since this is the [only folder that is shared with VM](https://github.com/docker/kitematic/issues/2738).

* Retrieve Google Play Mycelium APK from your phone
  Gets package path:

        $ adb shell pm path com.mycelium.wallet
        package:/data/app/com.mycelium.wallet-1/base.apk

  Retrieve file:

        $ adb pull /data/app/com.mycelium.wallet-1/base.apk mycelium-signed.apk
        
* Extract content from both apks you want to compare, using [ApkTool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/):

        java -jar ~/path/to/apktool.jar d mbw-prodnet-release.apk
        java -jar ~/path/to/apktool.jar d mycelium-signed.apk

* Compare signed apk with unsigned locally built apk using a diff tool

        diff --brief --recursive  mbw-prodnet-release/ mycelium-signed/ | grep -v "META-INF/CERT.RSA\|META-INF/CERT.SF\|META-INF/MANIFEST.MF"

* The expected difference between these files are elements that depend on the signature, that only
  the project's maintainer can reproduce:
  
  * `original/META-INF/CERT.RSA` 
  * `original/META-INF/CERT.SF` 
  * `original/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`
